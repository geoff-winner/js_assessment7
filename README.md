###Description
The PIZZA PIZZA app will fulfill all your wildest pizza desires... Or allow you to order pizzas. It also gives totals for pizzas already ordered without adding more pizzas and gives total dollar amounts for individual types and both types together.

Links to a <a href="http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> CDN for CSS Styling.
jQuery included.

HAVE FUN!
